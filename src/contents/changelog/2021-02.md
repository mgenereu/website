![VS Code on Gitpod](/images/changelog/2021-02-28.jpg)

## Synchronize Theia user settings with VS Code

We recently launched [support for VS Code](/blog/root-docker-and-vscode#vs-code).

If you switch your editor to VS Code, your user settings and extensions configured in Theia will be synchronized with VS Code automatically when you start a new workspace (unless you manually uploaded an extension).

### Fixes and improvements
