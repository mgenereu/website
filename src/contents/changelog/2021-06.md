## Introducing the Gitpod Local Companion app

As of today, you can access your Gitpod workspace from your local environment ðŸŽ‰!

**Why does this matter?**
Imagine you start a development server for your web application in Gitpod. You can preview that online at a https://nnnn-x.y.gitpod.io URL, where "nnnn" is the port your dev server listens on. Sometimes though, development features such as live reloading may not be compatible with that URL format and rather require something like http://localhost:10000 to communicate with the dev server.

With the Gitpod Local Companion app, localhost URLs can now access your dev server running in a Gitpod workspace. The best part of that: It works with any TCP port. You could run a MySQL database in your Gitpod workspace and access the database with your favourite GUI through localhost:3306.

To learn more and get started today, please see [our introduction blog post](/blog/local-app).
