title: Introducing Teams & Projects
---

Our mission here at Gitpod has always been about removing friction from the lives of developers.

Today, we're excited to share with you the next big step in this journey—Teams and Projects.

## Wait, what

At its heart, Gitpod is a CI/CD system for dev environments. It provides your team with consistent, standardized and fully-automated dev environments. When you use Gitpod, you can launch new workspaces in a flash, for any project and any context, and then throw them away again when the job is done.

**Disposable workspaces feel like inbox-zero 🧘‍♀️**

But before you and your team can get there, there have always been a few caveats, a few obstacles standing annoyingly between you and that frictionless dev experience:

- It's complicated to describe your project's setup in the [.gitpod.yml](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-gitpod-file/) syntax
- It's complicated to enable [Prebuilds](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds/) for your project—you never know if they're running, when they fail, and you can't get the build logs anywhere
- It's complicated to create a Team in Gitpod and to invite your team members

**Thankfully, all this changes today.**

## Introducing: Teams and Projects

Our goal with this latest update is to resolve the three pain points listed above, specifically by:

- Providing a nicer experience for teams
- Making it easier than ever to configure Gitpod for your project, saving a lot of time in the long run
- Making Prebuilds a first-class feature that is easy to set up, easy to observe and to troubleshoot

## 1. Teams

We're making it easy to create and to manage your Team.

- Create a new Team in just a few clicks and give it a recognizable name (teams are free and you can create as many as you want)
- Invite your colleagues, collaborators, or students with a simple (revokable) invite link
- Choose who is a Member or an Owner—you can even have multiple Owners
- Add GitHub or GitLab repositories to your Team in order to create Projects

> ℹ️ Note: For now, this new Teams feature is completely independent of Gitpod’s current Team Plans.
>
> If you’re currently managing, or you’re a member of, a Team Plan, it will remain unchanged, regardless of what new Teams you create or how many Members you invite. The new Teams & Projects are free for the time being, and in the coming months, we will be looking to improve our subscriptions & pricing model (with usage-based pricing!) and will likely add new billing features to Teams. More news on this pretty soon!

## Projects

We are also making it easy to add your projects and automate them with Gitpod.

- Projects make it easier to import your projects into Gitpod, and to make Gitpod continuously pre-build new dev environments for all your branches and PRs—thus putting precompiled and ready-to-code workspaces at your fingertips. ⚡

## What’s Next?

This is just the first leg in the journey, with more goodness still in the pipeline. We encourage you to try creating a Team, inviting team members and creating your first Projects with the new UI, hopefully seeing your first Prebuilds run (or fail!) As always, please report any problems or rough edges you notice, and let us know if you have ideas on how we could improve this further.
